Welcome to this Github repository about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)! This repository is an introduction to GANs, a type of deep learning algorithm used to generate new data that is similar to its training data. It is also a walkthrough of the code used to create GANs. We will provide a brief overview of GANs and the code needed to build them. We will also provide a detailed explanation of the various components of GANs, including the generator and the discriminator, and how they interact with each other to generate new data. Finally, we will discuss how GANs can be used for various applications. We hope you enjoy learning about GANs and creating your own!
